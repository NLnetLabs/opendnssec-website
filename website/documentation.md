The [documentation for OpenDNSSEC](https://opendnssec.readthedocs.io/) gives information on how to install, configure, and run OpenDNSSEC. Also in our docs we host a list of [frequently asked questions](https://opendnssec.readthedocs.io/en/latest/faq/). New users might be interested in our [OpenDNSSEC Initial Deployment Guide](https://www.opendnssec.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/opendnssec-start-guide.pdf).

### SoftHSM

For the latest documentation for SoftHSM see the [SoftHSM website](https://www.softhsm.org/).

### HSM

Remember that you also need an [HSM](https://opendnssec.readthedocs.io/en/latest/hsmbuyers/#types-of-hsms), which uses the PKCS#11 interface. [SoftHSM](https://www.softhsm.org/), originally part of the OpenDNSSEC project, is a software-only implementation of an HSM.

Read the [HSM Buyerâ€™s Guide](https://opendnssec.readthedocs.io/en/latest/hsmbuyers/) for more information and consult the [list of HSM vendors](https://opendnssec.readthedocs.io/en/latest/hsmbuyers/#vendors).
