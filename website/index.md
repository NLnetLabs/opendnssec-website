## The OpenDNSSEC project

OpenDNSSEC is a policy-based zone signer that automates the process of keeping track of DNSSEC keys and the signing of zones. The goal of the project is to make DNSSEC easy to deploy. The project is Open Source and intends to drive adoption of Domain Name System Security Extensions (DNSSEC) to further enhance Internet security.

## OpenDNSSEC 2.1.14

Version 2.1.14 of OpenDNSSEC has been released on 2024-08-22.

**News**

This is a mainenance release that fixes some bugs and adds robustness for HSM outages.  Apart from a minor fix to the backup keys command and export keys, it solved an issue where keys were not published soon enough in special cases in combination with <SharedKeys> directive.  In case you use shared keys, you must update.  But this is a good idea anyway.

## OpenDNSSEC 2.1.13

Version 2.1.13 of OpenDNSSEC has been released on 2023-06-26.

**News**

This release fixes a bug that affects both signer and enforcer command
line handling. Under heavy usage of the command line there was a small
change for a crash.
Furthermore there is a small behavioural change for users of the “keep”
policy. The back-off for retrying a sign task change is now equal to
the resign period in case the input file isn’t available or updated.
This because users nearly always will emit an external sign command for
this period. This will reduce logging errors.
